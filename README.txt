In your RStudio, please open all codes in the folder first, then follow the order below to run each script :
1.	req_functions.R
2.	comp_irrigation_saved_yield_reduction.R
3.	supply_curve.R
4.	streamflow_aug_n_cost.R
5.	Fifteenmile.R
While running all scripts, please set the working directory in the first script, “req_functions.R”. 
The other script in the folder  “daily_data_calc.R” is not required to run; this one calculates irrigation demand from the daily file. The daily file is too large and not provided in the data folder; unless you have the daily file, this script won’t run.
